 * so a user whose shell routes them through a proxy reasonably expects this tool to follow; when
 * it does not, the request goes out directly and fails somewhere that says nothing about proxies.
 *
 * It declines whenever starting again could make things worse than going direct:
 * - `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` or `--use-env-proxy` is already present, either way. `0` is how a user
 *   opts out, and a value we set ourselves is how the restarted process knows not to loop.
 * - The runtime predates the switch, which would ignore it.
 * - Any proxy variable holds something other than an `http:` or `https:` URL. Node.js refuses to
 *   start at all once the switch is on and it meets, say, `socks5://` or a bare `host:port`.
